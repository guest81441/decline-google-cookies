### Decline-Google-Cookies

A simple, fast [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) script that declines google cookies.

Declining google cookies is especially annoying, when you have automatic cookie deletion enabled.
So i created this script which does it for you. It works great for English UK/US in Youtube, Google search and Google maps.

Please submit a pull request on [Github](https://github.com/kakka0903/decline-google-cookies) if you have any suggestions for changes or bug fixes, and I will integrate them in the project :)
